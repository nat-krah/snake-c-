Snake game written for unix terminal in C++. This is a practice project to get a better understanding of C++ and using a terminal as a game engine. 
According to the references I am using, it should work on any Unix terminal, but that might not hold up.
Feel free to point out flaws in the code, I am very much still learning.
I'm using g++ to compile it and running it on the kitty terminal emulator.
