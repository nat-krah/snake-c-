Snake game written for unix terminal in C++
This is a practice project to get a better understanding of C++ and using a terminal as a game engine
According to the references I am using, it should work on any Unix terminal, but that might not hold up
Feel free to create an issue if one arises
I'm using g++ to compile it and running it on the kitty terminal emulator
